Implicit:
Implicit wait tells your webDriver wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an "No such Element exception".
Implicit wait is written only once and will be applied for the whole session/execution.
We can say Implicit wait is also called global wait.

Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds. If your element is located in 3 seconds the rest time will be ignored.
Your script will move on to the next action. It will be applied only for findElement() or findElements() method.

Syntax: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
