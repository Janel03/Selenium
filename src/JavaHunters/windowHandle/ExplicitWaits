Explicit waits or WebDriver wait:
    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,20);
    wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("")));
It is used to tell webDriver to wait for a certain or expected condition before throwing "ElementNotVisibleException".
Explicit wait works with ExceptedConditional class waits until the condition is met or the given time is achieved.
